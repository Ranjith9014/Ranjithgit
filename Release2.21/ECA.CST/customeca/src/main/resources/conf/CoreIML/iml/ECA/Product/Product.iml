An interface to hold all the business methods relating to products (that is,.
products that are available for a customer to purchase).
<p>
  Products are the entities which are purchased by accounts and are grouped
  into families of related products. Products may be parents of other products.
  For example, Call Waiting is dependent on Line Rental and is thus a child
  product. A child
  product inherits the price plan of its parent when taken by an account.
