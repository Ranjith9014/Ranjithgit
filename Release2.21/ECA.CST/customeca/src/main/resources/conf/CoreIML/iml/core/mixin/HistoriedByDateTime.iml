Information in Infinys Rating and Billing can be historied. This means 
different copies
of the data are stored which are effective on different date (and
time) ranges. These ranges can cover the past, present and
future. Data beans which describe information are effective for one
particular data and time range implemented in this interface.

<p>This interface is used when date and time are taken
into account. When time is not taken into account,
HistoriedByDate is used instead.</p>

<p>This interface uses inclusive end date and times in the same way
as the Infinys Rating and Billing schema. However this has been found
to be a frequent source of "off by one" errors so new beans will 
use DateTimeRange instead, which uses exclusive end date and times; that 
is, one second later.</p>
