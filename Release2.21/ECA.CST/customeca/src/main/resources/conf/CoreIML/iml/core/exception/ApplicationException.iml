<![CDATA[
This is the base class for all application specific exceptions.
<p>
  All business methods will be declared as throwing this exception. They
  will also be declared as throwing the specific subclasses which are relevant
  to the method. Although this is redundant as far as the Java compiler is
  concerned, it clarifies to the client of this API which exceptions they might
  choose to handle.
  <p>
    There are two reasons for always declaring business methods as throwing
    this exception. Both are related to keeping the API backwards compatible to
    clients using an earlier version of the API. It allows later versions of
    the API to throw additional subclasses of this exception without the method
    signature becoming incompatible. It provides a generic mechanism of
    reporting errors from business logic in the database tier. The errors are
    reported without having to categorise them as a specific subclass while
    leaving the option open to incrementally categorize the errors as
    subclasses in later versions.
    <p>
      There are only two direct subclasses of this class,
      ParameterException and BusinessLogicException.
