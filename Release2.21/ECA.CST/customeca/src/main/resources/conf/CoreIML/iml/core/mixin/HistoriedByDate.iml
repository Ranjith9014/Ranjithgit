Information in Infinys Rating and Billing can be historied. This 
means different
copies of the data are stored which are effective on different date
(and time) ranges. These ranges can cover the past, present and
future. Data beans which describe the information are effective for one
particular data range implemented in this interface.

<p>This interface is only used when the date, but not time, is taken
into account. When time is taken into account historiedByDateTime
is used instead.</p>

<p>This interface uses inclusive end dates in the same way as the
Infinys Rating and Billing schema. However this has been found to be
a frequent source of "off by one" errors so new beans will use dateRange 
instead, which uses exclusive end dates; that is, one day later.</p>
